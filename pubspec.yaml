  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
      - images/
      - Animations/WuuD_Splash.flr
      - Animations/SequencedLoader.flr

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Roboto Medium
       fonts:
          - asset: fonts/Bold.ttf
     - family: Swiper
       fonts:
          - asset: fonts/Swiper.ttf
#           style: regular
     - family: Roboto
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
